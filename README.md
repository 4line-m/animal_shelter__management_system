## The brief:

```
The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can 
be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. 
Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

MVP:

- A list of all their animals and their admission date
- Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable
- Assign an animal to a new owner
- List all the owners and their adopted animals
```
